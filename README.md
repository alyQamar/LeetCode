# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode repository! This repository contains my solutions to various problems on LeetCode.com, a popular platform for preparing for technical interviews.

## Repository Structure

The solutions are organized by problem number and name on leetCode. Each problem has its own directory, containing the following files:

- `problem.md`: A markdown file describing the problem and its constraints.
- `solution.cpp`: A cpp or another language file containing my solution to the problem.
- `NOTES.md`: A markdown file contain problem notes if it exists.

## How to Use

You can use this repository as a resource to study for your own technical interviews, or as a way to practice and improve your problem-solving skills.

To use this repository, simply navigate to the problem you're interested in and read through the `problem.md` file to understand the problem statement. Then, take a look at the `solution.cpp` file to see my implementation of the solution.

If you want to test the solution for yourself, you can copy the code from `solution.cpp` and run it in your local cpp environment.

## Contributions

I welcome contributions to this repository, whether in the form of new solutions, bug fixes, or improvements to existing solutions. If you would like to contribute, please create a pull request and I will review it as soon as possible.

Thank you for visiting my LeetCode repository! I hope you find it useful in your own journey to ace your technical interviews.
